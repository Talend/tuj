In an interview with ABC News' Jake Tapper for "World News With Charles Gibson", Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., who has received Kennedy's endorsement for president, said, "It's heartbreaking. Ted Kennedy is not only a giant of the Senate, but he's a good friend. You couldn't have a better supporter than Ted Kennedy."

Obama talked with Vicki Kennedy, the senator's wife, Saturday and said he was more optimistic after that converstion.

"The news came in today and it's a lot worse, but he's a fighter. He's been fighting on behalf of working families all his life. бн It's a testament to how beloved he is that you are seeing well wishes from across the aisle from everyone in political life and Massachusetts."

In a statement released to the press, Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., who is preparing for an election night rally in Kentucky, said, "Ted Kennedy's courage and resolve are unmatched, and they have made him one of the greatest legislators in Senate history. Our thoughts are with him and Vicki and we are praying for a quick and full recovery."
